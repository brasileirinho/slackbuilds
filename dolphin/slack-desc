# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dolphin: compatibility is good - one can expect "mainstream" titles to run;
dolphin: lesser known titles can be hit or miss. Triforce compatibility is
dolphin: currently limited to a couple of games - others require more of the
dolphin: Triforce-specific peripheral devices to be emulated.
